<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This Power BI case study focuses on analyzing a real-world eCommerce dataset to gain valuable insights for an online pet supply company, Whiskique. The process begins with Power Query, which is used to clean and transform the data, identifying trends in sales performance and customer demographics. DAX is then leveraged to create meaningful visualizations, helping to highlight key business metrics. Finally, all findings are brought together in an interactive dashboard, enabling data-driven decision-making for the executive team.

## Key Features

- **Shipping Cost and Savings Analysis: Financial Impact Evaluation**  
The dashboard highlights total shipping costs at $385.15K (baseline), with a "what-if" scenario showing potential costs of $266.96K, resulting in savings of $118.19K, enabling stakeholders to evaluate the financial impact of adjusting shipped quantities and optimize logistics strategies.

- **Impact of Shipped Quantity on Costs by Product Category: Category-Level Insights**  
A histogram illustrates the distribution of shipped quantities across categories like Pet Food (531 units on average), Cleaning Supplies (456 units), and Electronics (1.38 units), paired with a bar chart showing corresponding shipping costs, revealing high-cost categories like Pet Food for targeted optimization.

- **Shipping Cost Trends Over Time: Temporal Cost Analysis**  
A line chart tracks shipping costs by store and region from January 2021 to November 2021, comparing a baseline running total of $18.19M with a "what-if" scenario, identifying trends like a mid-2021 cost peak to help stakeholders pinpoint inefficiencies and adjust operations.

- **Regional Distribution of Shipping Costs: Geographic Cost Breakdown**  
A world map visual displays shipping costs by region (Central, East, North, West), with North America showing the highest activity, helping identify high-cost regions like the East for implementing targeted cost-saving measures.

- **Interactive Scenario Analysis: Dynamic "What-If" Simulations**  
The dashboard features a "what-if" parameter for shipped quantity (set to 11 units), allowing users to simulate the impact of shipment volume changes on costs, empowering stakeholders to test scenarios and make data-driven decisions on resource allocation.



<h2>Tech Stack </h2>

- <b>Power BI Expertise: Utilized Power BI to create an interactive dashboard with advanced features like what-if parameters, histograms, line charts, and geographic maps.</b>

- <b>Data Analysis: Analyzed shipping data to uncover trends, such as cost variations by category and region, and evaluated the financial impact of operational changes.</b> 

- <b>Data Visualization: Designed clear and impactful visuals to communicate complex logistics data, making it accessible to non-technical stakeholders.</b>
  
- <b>Scenario Modeling: Implemented what-if analysis to enable dynamic cost forecasting, showcasing my ability to build tools for strategic decision-making.</b> 


<h2>Why This Project? </h2>

- <b>The "Shipping Metrics" dashboard in Power BI was created to optimize shipping operations for a retail business by analyzing costs, quantities, and regional performance. It identifies high-cost categories like Pet Food (531 units) and shows potential savings of $118.19K by reducing shipped quantities from $385.15K to $266.96K. The dashboard breaks down quantities across categories, such as Cleaning Supplies (456 units), to target inefficiencies. It also maps high-cost regions like the East and tracks cost trends through 2021 to support strategic planning. A "what-if" parameter (11 units) enables cost impact simulations, aiding decision-making. As a case study, it showcases Power BI skills in data analysis and visualization, making it a strong portfolio piece for data analyst roles in retail or supply chain management.

Why It Matters: This project reduces shipping costs, enhances efficiency, and highlights expertise in Power BI for actionable insights.</b>
